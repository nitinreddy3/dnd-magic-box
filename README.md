# Getting Started with Drag and drop the boxes

## Feature

There are three categories 
1. Common - Here all the elements are persisted
2. Category A - User can drag and drop elements from "Common" category to this category but only the ones which starts with Category Id
3. Category B - Same as explained for Category A

At the end a user can reset the list items which will go back to the initial state.
